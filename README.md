# Hdbscan-Anomaly-Detection
This project contains the codes for anomaly detection using HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). In this project, I explored and implemented a robust anomaly detection technique leveraging the power of density-based clustering.

Key Features:

1. HDBSCAN Algorithm: Discover how HDBSCAN, a hierarchical variant of DBSCAN, can effectively identify clusters and anomalies in your dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Learn about essential data preprocessing steps to enhance the performance of anomaly detection.
3. Visualizations: Visualize the clustering results and anomalies detected using interactive plots and insightful visual representations.
4. Real-world Application: Explore a practical example or dataset where anomaly detection using HDBSCAN can be applied.

Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,pyplot, hdbscan
IDE used: Jupyter Notebook
